I'm also a blogger, and you can check out my tech-related articles and tutorials on my blog, [jotoh.dev](https://jotoh.dev).

To support some articles, I've also created some small projects that you can find in my repositories:

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
Let's connect and make the coding world a better place together! 🚀
